These are more CDS because from what I understand they are 'hypothetical' protein coding area. A annotating algorithm marks things that look like protein coding regions and these are CDS. However they do not always make proteins because the gene was broken a long time ago or never served any purpose and happened by chance. It would follow that there are more CDS than proteins because every protein belongs to a CDS but there can be CDs without ever having a protein.

 4.     cp GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gff test.gff
	grep -o -P '\ttRNA\t' test.gff | wc -l

output = 86

5.      grep -o -P 'RefSeq\t[a-zA-Z]*\t' test.gff | sort | uniq -c

output =
